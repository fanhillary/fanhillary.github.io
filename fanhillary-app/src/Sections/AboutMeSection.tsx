           Layout: Two-column structure with an image of you (maybe in a cozy cafe environment) on one side and text on the other.
Text Example: “Hi, I'm [Your Name], a frontend developer who loves blending functionality with an inviting user experience. When I’m not coding, you can find me sipping lattes and reading about new design trends.”
Styling: Background with subtle texture to resemble paper, like a café menu card.
        </Box>
